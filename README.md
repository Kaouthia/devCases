# devCases
This is my archive of 3D printable cases for development boards I've designed.

Most of these cases are one-off prints purely for code development. IE, you pop the dev board inside the case, glue it shut, and you're done.

When I develop using microcontrollers, I like to have one board of each type in an enclosed case so that I can plug it into my laptop and I don't have to worry about the board touching or shorting out on anything. There is no access to the pins with these cases. This archive won't be updated often. It'll just be as and when I need to make a new board, it will be added here for others to download.
